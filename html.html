    <h1>H1 = Heading 1</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph (&lt;P&gt;). IMHO, it makes sense to have vertical spacing between header elements and paragraphs.</p>
    <p>This is also a paragraph.</p>
    <p>Line 1: This is a paragraph with four lines but:<br>Line 2: It has self-terminating<br>Line 3: line breaks (&lt;br/&gt;) at<br>Line 4: the end of every line</p>
    <p>You might want to use the (&lt;br/&gt;) tag for multi-line list items like this</p>
